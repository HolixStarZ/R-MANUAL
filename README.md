# R-MANUAL
This manaul is a R manual created for lab members in Rio lab. Going over the basics of scRNAseq, cell cluster identifications, cell trajectory, and other basic information, we hope this manual will help you created diagrams and graphs that are publicataion ready. Follow the instructed steps and save often, because usually working with large amount of data makes your device prone to crashing. 

This manual is also update frqeuntly as newer methods appear (hopefully), and more information is due to be recorded in this manual.
